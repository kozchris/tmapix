0.4.0 SNAPSHOT -- 2010-08-01
----------------------------

  (reference to reified construct was written without a fragment identifier)
- Fixed bug in JTM serialiazation 
  (missing si: prefix in type-instance associations)
- Added XTM 2.1 writer
- Fixed bug in XTM 2.0 serialization (instanceOf element was written multiple
  times, only one instance element is allowed per topic).
- Deprecated several XTM* reader classes in favor of *one* XTM reader
- Switched to mio-syntaxpack to reduce the no of necessary
  libs in the classpath (it's still possible to use the many mio-libs, though)
- Fixed bug in LTM 1.3 writer
  (multiple subject locators were written even if LTM supports just one)
- TM/XML writer tries to detect a matching item identifier (for the provided
  base locator) and uses it to assign a topic id.

  one type.
