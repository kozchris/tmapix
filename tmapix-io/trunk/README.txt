TMAPIX I/O
==========

TMAPIX I/O is a library to read and write topic maps with a TMAPI-compatible
Topic Maps processor, i.e. tinyTiM <http://tinytim.sourceforge.net/>.

To use TMAPIX I/O, put the tmapix-io-<VERSION>.jar, the 
mio-syntaxpack-<VERSION>.jar and the mio-core-<VERSION>.jar (from the /lib directory) 
into the classpath.

To validate XML topic maps like TM/XML or XTM topic maps, the jing lib is required
as well.

If you want to use TMAPIX I/O with Ontopia <http://www.ontopia.net/>, the
ontopia-mio-<VERSION>.jar recommended.

Further, you need the SLF4J lib and an implementation, i.e. slf4j-jdk14.
