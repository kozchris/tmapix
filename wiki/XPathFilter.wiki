= XPathFilter =

The `com.semagia.tmapix.filter.xpath` package provides a `com.semagia.tmapix.filter.IFilter` implementation that utilizes [http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath XPath 1.0] expressions to navigate through the [http://www.isotopicmaps.org/sam/sam-model/ Topic Maps - Data Model (TMDM)].

The axes names are aligned to TMDM, an overview can be found at [XPathAxes].


== Quickstart ==

In your application you should always use the `IFilter` interface since it keeps your implementation independent of the concrete `IFilter` implementation. 
To create a `IFilter` which utilizes XPath, use the `com.semagia.tmapix.filter.xpath.XPathFilter`:

{{{
import com.semagia.tmapix.filter.IFilter;
import com.semagia.tmapix.filter.xpath.XPathFilter;

IFilter<Role> filter = XPathFilter.create("role");

// Iterates through all roles the topic is playing
for (Role role: filter.match(topic)) {
   doSomethingWith(role);
}

}}}
